So
long
as
there
shall
exist
by

of
law
and
custom

damnation
pronounced
society
artificially
creating
hells
amid
the
civilization
earth

to
divine
destiny

three
great
problems
century
degradation
man
through
pauperism
corruption
woman
hunger
crippling
children
lack
light
are
unsolved
social
asphyxia
is
possible
in
any

world
other
words
with
a
still
wider
